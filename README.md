# Collaborative mapping of unknown environments

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Unknown subterranial areas holds a certain risk for humans to discover and survey. Utilizing modern day technology within robotics, one can minimize these risks.<br>
This project is constructed around this problem, and the goal is to develop software for existing robots to collaborate and map unknown areas such as tunnels and caves. Working on this project is a team of seven students from the Lule√• University of Technology. Each student with a background in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Control theory.
